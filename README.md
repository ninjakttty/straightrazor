bootstrap
=========

yuri's node bootstrap


this is a very simple node bootstrap to install

npm install && bower install

this will setup a very basic page with

* Backbone
* Marionette
* Underscore
* JQuery

all loaded though require, to install any other front end javascript use 

**bower install <*package name*>** 

then 

**grunt bower**
